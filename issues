issue 1:

Running test in mocha for the first time.(mergin individual test in describe) I was getting below error.

But the other errors appears this time:

$ ./node_modules/.bin/wdio

FFFF

0 passing (11.60s)

4 failing

Resolve: Changed sync option true to false in wdio.config file. 
Reason: In v4 all commands are synchronous if you are using wdio."


issue 2.

In both it tests I mentioned pause 3000 sec. I was getting below error.

Timeout of 10000ms exceeded. 

Resolve: Reduce 3000 sec to 2000 sec in both it tests and it works fine.
